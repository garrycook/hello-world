# hello-world (written by Ringmaster)

So, I started this journey while attending the circus. I feel like Mr. Do, all I do is attend the circus these days.
Or, as the vendor likes to say, "It's like going to the dentist. You just want to get it done." Well, we must have really BAD teeth.
We should brush more, so we don't have to visit the dentist any longer.
